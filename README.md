# LA County - "Our Children First" Orientation Skipper
Skip the "unskippable" videos and reveal answers to all questions

http://ww2.lacourt.org/ourChildrenFirst

## How to use

1. Open developer tools in your browser when viewing a page

2. Copy all code in `main.js`.

3. Paste into developer tools and run

## What happens

When viewing videos, a "continue" button will appear.

When viewing questions, a small black window will appear on the bottom left of the screen that reveals all answers to questions

## Why this was made

I got bored sitting through the orientation, so I made this to skip it after being instructed to do it 3 times.
