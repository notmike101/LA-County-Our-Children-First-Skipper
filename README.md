Skip the "unskippable" videos and reveal answers to all questions

http://ww2.lacourt.org/ourChildrenFirst

## How to use

1. Open developer tools in your browser when viewing a page

2. Copy all code in `main.js`.

3. Paste into developer tools and run

## What happens

When viewing videos, a "continue" button will appear.

When viewing questions, a small black window will appear on the bottom left of the screen that reveals all answers to questions

## Why this was made

I got bored sitting through the orientation, so I made this to skip it after being instructed to do it 3 times.

## Disclaimer

This is strictly for use if you need to quickly go through the orientation again and remember all information.
If you have not viewed the orientation and answered all questions truthfully in the past and have not recieved your certificate of completion, please do not use this script as it may result in revocation of your certificate of completion.
